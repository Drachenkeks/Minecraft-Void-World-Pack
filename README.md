# Minecraft-Void-World-Pack
test files and storage for the "Void World" (workingtitle) Modpack 

Currently working on:
- IE excavator and ore veins issues (might remove IE entirely...)
- [on hold] remodeling/-texturing pipes and blocks
- skyblock world generation tweaking
- ~~weather and mob spawning issues do to "the_void" biome~~
  - solved, no longer using "the_void"
- testing [finite water](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waterworks "CurseForge") and [waterworks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/finite-water-infinite-lava "CurseForge") for resource management potential
- figuring out story/context and quest structure
- creating custom items, blocks and properties with ContentTweaker and KubeJS
